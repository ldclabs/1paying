</h2>
<h3 id="1-vision-empowering-individuals-and-developers">1. Vision: Empowering Individuals and Developers</h3>
<p><a href="https://solscan.io/token/PAYiNGqaLFRdBomkQY3JXZeCm7wzK7hKuhrJDzcZBWN" target="_blank"><b>PAY</b></a> is the
    core engine of the <a href="https://1pay.ing" target="_blank">1Pay.ing</a> ecosystem, a native value-transfer token
    built on the Solana
    blockchain. Our vision extends beyond a simple technical solution; we are building a dual-sided platform that serves
    as a <strong>smart payment portal for individual users</strong> and a <strong>seamless integration tool for
        developers</strong>.</p>
<p>The design philosophy of the PAY token is a powerful <strong>dual-flywheel mechanism</strong>:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Proof-of-Adoption:</strong> Incentivizing developers to integrate the 1Pay.ing Kit, thereby expanding
        the ecosystem's footprint.</li>
    <li><strong>Proof-of-Usage:</strong> Incentivizing end-users to adopt the 1Pay.ing Wallet, thereby capturing and
        retaining network value.</li>
</ol>
<p>This dual-flywheel model ensures that the value of PAY is perfectly synchronized with the overall health of the
    ecosystem, measured by both the <strong>breadth of applications</strong> and the <strong>depth of user
        engagement</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="2-core-token-utilities-the-dual-flywheel">2. Core Token Utilities (The Dual Flywheel)</h3>
<p>The utility of the PAY token is structured along two primary tracks—<strong>Developer (B2D)</strong> and <strong>User
        (B2C)</strong>—ensuring every participant in the ecosystem is incentivized to contribute and empowered to
    capture value.</p>
<h4 id="21-empowering-developers-the-developer-flywheel">2.1. Empowering Developers (The Developer Flywheel)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Integrate-to-Earn:</strong> This is our primary weapon for market penetration. Developers who integrate
        the free and open-source 1Pay.ing Kit are rewarded with a continuous stream of PAY tokens based on the
        transaction volume their applications facilitate. This makes developers the earliest builders and financial
        beneficiaries of the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="22-empowering-users-the-user-flywheel">2.2. Empowering Users (The User Flywheel)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pay-to-Earn / Use-to-Earn:</strong> This is our core mechanism for user acquisition and retention. When
        a user makes any x402 payment through the <strong>1Pay.ing Wallet App</strong>, they receive a percentage of the
        transaction value back in PAY tokens as a <strong>Payment Rebate</strong>. This creates the Web3 equivalent of
        &quot;credit card cashback,&quot; turning every micropayment into a micro-investment.</li>
    <li><strong>In-Wallet Staking &amp; Yield (Stake-to-Earn):</strong> PAY tokens earned from rebates can be instantly
        staked within the wallet to earn a competitive yield (APR). This elevates the 1Pay.ing Wallet from a simple
        payment tool to a personal <strong>digital asset management hub</strong>, dramatically increasing user
        stickiness.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="23-shared-ecosystem-utilities">2.3. Shared Ecosystem Utilities</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Governance:</strong> All PAY holders, whether developers or users, can stake their tokens to receive
        <strong>vePAY</strong> and participate in the <strong>1Pay.ing DAO</strong>. They will collectively govern the
        protocol's future, including incentive parameters, treasury allocations, and the feature roadmap.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Privilege Access:</strong> The PAY token is the key to unlocking premium features across the ecosystem.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Developers:</strong> Staking PAY provides access to value-added services like gas subsidies,
                enterprise-grade SLAs, and advanced analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>For Users:</strong> Staking PAY can lead to higher Payment Rebate tiers, or unlock advanced
                wallet features like enhanced privacy controls and custom themes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-token-allocation--distribution">3. Token Allocation &amp; Distribution</h3>
<p><img src="https://1pay.ing/_assets/images/PAY_token_allocation.webp" alt="PAY token allocation chart"></p>
<p>The total fixed supply of PAY is <strong>1,000,000,000</strong> tokens, minted on the Solana blockchain at genesis.
    The allocation is designed to balance long-term growth, community ownership, and initial funding needs.</p>

<h3 id="4-go-to-market-strategy-fair-launch--liquidity">4. Go-to-Market Strategy: Fair Launch &amp; Liquidity</h3>
<p>To ensure a fair and transparent market launch, 1Pay.ing will conduct a <strong>Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool
        (LBP)</strong> on a trusted Solana-native platform like <strong>Streamflow</strong>.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP):</strong> We will conduct an LBP using <strong>10% (100M
            PAY)</strong> of the total supply on a leading Solana-native platform like <strong>Streamflow</strong>. This
        will achieve fair price discovery and raise <strong>$500k - $1M USDC</strong> in initial development capital.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Liquidity Lock Commitment:</strong> We make a binding public commitment that <strong>100% of the USDC
            raised</strong> in the LBP will be paired with the other <strong>10% (100M PAY)</strong> from the public
        sale allocation. This entire amount will be used to seed the initial liquidity pool on a major Solana DEX (e.g.,
        Orca, Raydium), and the resulting LP tokens will be verifiably locked for a minimum of one year. This is the
        strongest possible signal of our long-term commitment.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-the-1paying-flywheel">5. The 1Pay.ing Flywheel</h3>
<p>This token economic model is designed to create a self-reinforcing growth loop:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Penetration (SDK):</strong> &quot;Integrate-to-Earn&quot; incentives drive developers to embed the
        1Pay.ing Kit across a vast landscape of applications, creating ubiquitous <strong>points of entry</strong> for
        the wallet.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversion (Wallet):</strong> Users encounter these entry points and are seamlessly guided to download
        the 1Pay.ing Wallet to unlock a superior experience and earn <strong>Payment Rebates</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention (Incentives):</strong> &quot;Pay-to-Earn&quot; and in-wallet staking features dramatically
        increase user activity and retention, anchoring users within the 1Pay.ing ecosystem.</li>
    <li><strong>Synergistic Reinforcement (The Flywheels Connect):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A large <strong>wallet user base</strong> makes the 1Pay.ing Kit more attractive to new developers, as
                it gives them instant access to an active Web3 payment community (<strong>reinforcing the developer
                    flywheel</strong>).</li>
            <li>A growing number of <strong>integrated applications</strong> provides wallet users with more
                opportunities to spend and earn rebates, enhancing the wallet's utility (<strong>reinforcing the user
                    flywheel</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Value Accrual (The Loop Closes):</strong> The prosperity of the entire ecosystem (measured in TVP, DAU,
        etc.) drives intrinsic demand for the PAY token (for governance, staking, and privileges), capturing the
        network's value and distributing it back to all participants.</li>
</ol>
<p>By meticulously designing the PAY token economy, we are not just launching a token; we are launching a movement to
    equip the next generation of internet applications with a native value layer.</p>
